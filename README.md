# Linear Regression

This project demonstrates how different values of **weight** and **bias** affect the line that we fit to the data using simple linear regression.

## Data Distribution

Below is the data distribution of the sample I created:

## Line Fitting with Different Parameters

### Weight = 3, Bias = 3.5

This is what happens when the weight is 3 and the bias is 3.5:

![Weight 3, Bias 3.5](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e091fa09-e406-4c27-a85a-f5f8df6bb0aa)

### Weight = 3.5, Bias = 4

This is the result when the weight is 3.5 and the bias is 4:

![Weight 3.5, Bias 4](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/dd9e269d-6ab3-4329-9d41-d9defca76042)

## Try it Yourself!

Feel free to play around with the **weight** and **bias** values to see how different parameters affect the plot. 

## Upcoming Features

I will be adding the following soon:
- **Cost Function**: To evaluate how well the line fits the data.
- **Gradient Descent**: To optimize the weight and bias values.

Stay tuned for updates!
